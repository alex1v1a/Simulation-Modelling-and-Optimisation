how to find errors - what is causing the errors.



on Mars

2 moons, phobos and edbos

70,000km long

simulate this tower and wiggle it out of the moon

check the equations on the sheet

tower is like a long string, we can use wave equation which describes the long string - but we cant use tension because changes from bottom to top

Max tension at top and least at bottom

use the equations given and solve from 0 at ground level, to the end the next 0 will be the top of the point

1. Solutions for tension

2. wave equation (K constant isn't a constant) create a difference equation to move through time and along the tower.

Solution space for partial differential equation

a b & c matrix row by row.

6 units per 600 seconds

look for units out by a factor of 1000
