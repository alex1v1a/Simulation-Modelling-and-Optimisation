%\begin{abstract}

%In this assignment you will setup ROS on your computer and install Gazebo simulator. ROS has a number of robot models ready for using in Gazebo, of which you can choose one and link it to main ROS packages for tele-operation from your keyboard. Add a laser scanner (e.g. Hokuyo URG or Sick Scanner) to the robot making sure the scanner publishes laser data over ROS. One choice of the robot model could be Poineer-3DX which is also available in hardware form. Your simulated code will run on the real robot without modification.

I have come to a further understanding learned the fundamentals of ROS with the use of such simulation tools like Gazebo. I am aware of other simulation tools available but due to the community support this is a great place to start. The use of plugins with models to be controlled by the teleop python script is used in calibration with the rviz graphical output to help visualise the robots (models) sight.

This is a powerful tool and from the basic level of understanding is an extremely vital aspect of the mechatronics processing, it is a great skill to learn.
